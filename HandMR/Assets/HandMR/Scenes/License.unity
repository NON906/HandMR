    shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n    Object form, made

    \   \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n    form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n    editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n    represent, as a whole,
    an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n    of this License, Derivative
    Works shall not include works that remain\n    separable from, or merely link

    Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n    this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n    worldwide, non-exclusive,

    \   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n    with
    the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n    institute patent
    litigation against any entity (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in
    a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n    or a Contribution incorporated within the
    Work constitutes direct\n    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce
    and distribute copies of the\n    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
    with or without\n    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
    You\n    meet the following conditions:\n    (a) You must give any other recipients

    and\n        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n        excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n        the Derivative Works;
    and\n    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n        distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n        include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\n        within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not\n        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
    in at least one\n        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
    \       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n        documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n        within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n        wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n    You
    may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide
    additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction,
    or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as
    a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
    complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n5. Submission of Contributions.
    Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms
    and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
    \   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the
    terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
    Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
    express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
    \   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of
    using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n    risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no
    event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n9.
    Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work
    or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for,
    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations,
    You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not
    on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
    \   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX:

    \  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1. Definitions.\n\n
    \     \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n

    shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n      Object form, made
    available under the License, as indicated by a\n      copyright notice that is
    included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix
    below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
    Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
    the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
    \     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
    \     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
    \     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n
    \     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean
    any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and
    any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
    the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
    on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
    sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
    to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n

    of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source
    or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in
    this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell,
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only
    to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
    \     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute
    patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim
    in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \     as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may
    reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof
    in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form,
    provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must
    give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent
    notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must
    retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute,
    all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes
    a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
    Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
    \         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the
    License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated
    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
    \     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
    the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\"
    BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
    \     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
    such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n
    \  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License
    to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n
    \     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced
